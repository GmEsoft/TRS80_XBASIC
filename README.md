XBASIC - Extended BASIC Level II for TRS-80 Model I Cassette

## Description

This is an extension for the TRS-80 Model I ROM BASIC Level II, I wrote in the mid 80's, using Editor/Assembler.

I recently recovered the source code from cassette, from six separate files, and merged them into one single big .ASM file. 
This file can be assembled to a 500 baud .CAS file using George Phillips's ZMAC assembler.

This project is purely for sharing my early work on the Z80... There are certainly bugs and poor error checking, but I don't intend to make that code evolve.
